About my upcoming project:

> UniRide is a mobile application developed specifically for streamlining university campus transportation. This platform offers real-time visibility of all campus shuttle routes, displaying the current location and predicted arrival times at each designated stop. Key features include an intuitive map interface, customizable notifications for selected routes and stops, and comprehensive accessibility information. A built-in feedback mechanism allows users to report issues and suggest improvements, contributing to a more efficient and responsive campus transit system.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The initial phase of the app development in Xcode involved a period of familiarization with the platform's structure. Connecting the user interface elements to the application's logic posed some initial difficulties, leading to integration issues. Nonetheless, these challenges help add to a more practical and refined understanding of iOS development.
